# Ball World

This is a quick exercise to help familiarize yourself with JavaScript /
Jquery.

### Getting started

  *  Clone / fork this repo
  *  Take a look at the code. The work you'll do is in ball_world.js,
     but it will be good to know the structure of the html and the css classes as well
  *  Open up ball_world.html in a browser. Look at what you've got, then
     go ahead and get started on the requirements


### Requirements

When you are done, you should be able to use the buttons on the right to:

  *  Add a ball to the window
  *  Select a ball
  *  Remove selected balls from the window
  *  Change all selected balls' colors to a randomly generated color
  *  Have all selected balls bounce around the window (think screen
     saver)
  *  Stop the movement of all selected balls
